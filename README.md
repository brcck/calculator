# calculator

I discovered the (much maligned) `eval()` part-way through this project. While it would have been much simpler to utilize it, I decided pressing on as-is would be good practice anyway.

## Features
- Two operands
- Both operands display at once
- Add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Result carries over for next operation
- Buttons to clear and delete
- Divide by zero handling
- I mean come on, it's a calculator.
